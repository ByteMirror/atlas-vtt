## New

- Select several assets or folders in the asset manager like in a file manager: Ctrl/Cmd-click adds or removes single items, Shift-click selects everything between the last clicked item and the one you click.
- Ctrl/Cmd+A in the asset manager selects all items of one kind: every folder when a folder is selected, otherwise every asset in the current view.
- Import tokens from Fantasy Statblocks in bulk. Preview creatures with local artwork, choose a collection, and create linked tokens while skipping existing imports and preserving original notes and images.
- Hold Shift and click tokens to add them to or remove them from the selection, then drag any of them to move the whole group.
- New scenes align their grid to the map image on their own the first time they open. Maps without a grid simply open without one; the grid alignment tool remains available for corrections.
- Read what's new after an Atlas update and browse previous releases in an offline changelog. Open it anytime with the View changelog command or from Atlas settings.
- Turn automatic update announcements on or off in Atlas settings or in the changelog.
- Report a bug or suggest a feature from inside Obsidian with the Report an issue command or from Atlas settings under Help and feedback. Atlas fills in your Atlas and Obsidian versions and submits your report directly, preserving the chosen issue type and affected area. No GitHub account or second form is needed.

## Improved
- Fantasy Statblocks artwork now opens in the same token import cards as uploaded images, with crop controls, tags for selected tokens, and individual or global ring choices.

- Fantasy Statblocks imports now open inside the existing token creator. Filter by system/layout and choose the Atlas ring for all tokens or individually. Tokens imported without a ring retain their full artwork on the map.

- Grid auto-detect now lines up across the whole map instead of drifting towards the edges, finds faint grids on busy art, and no longer reports a grid on maps that have none or picks the wrong grid type. The result tells you how much of the map the grid was found on.

## Fixed
- Token import ring controls now share the editable preview state, and fast-loading images no longer get stuck optimizing.

- Creating a token from a statblock image no longer mistakes the source artwork for an existing token.
- Opening a settings dropdown closes the previous one, including when switching with the keyboard or between map views.
- Grid settings dropdowns keep opening after other map tabs close, and size to their button unless longer options need more room.

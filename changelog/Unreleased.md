## Fixed

- Large (2×2) and Gargantuan (4×4) tokens snap to where cells meet, so they cover whole cells: on square grids to the corners where grid lines cross, on hex grids to the corner three hexes share, so a Large creature covers 3 hexes and a Gargantuan one 12 (a Huge one stays on a hex and covers 7). This holds when you drag, place, paste or duplicate them and when an encounter spawns them. Before, they snapped to the middle of a cell like Medium tokens. A token you resize keeps the cell its footprint starts from, so it stays on the grid at its new size

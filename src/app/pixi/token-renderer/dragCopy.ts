 * Alt/Option-drag: copies the dragged tokens where they stand, so the drag carries the copies
 * away and the originals stay put. Drawings in the selection are copied too; their copies stay
 * behind while the drawing drag keeps moving the originals, which reads the same on screen.
 * The moving group becomes the selection.
 *
 * Call it inside the drag's history transaction, which makes the copy and the move one undo
 * step, and before anything has moved: the token drag registers its pointer listener before
 * the drawing drag, so this runs first on the move that crosses the drag threshold.
 * Returns the token copies' ids with their start positions, or null when nothing was copied.
